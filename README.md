# 🧩 RetireTrack – Agile Case Management Simulation (SAFe Framework)

This is a simulated Agile project designed to demonstrate real-world application of the SAFe Agile framework, aligned with MetLife’s "Business Solutions Consultant" role expectations.

## 🔍 Project Overview

**RetireTrack** is a Case Management Dashboard for MetLife teams to track retirement solution cases. It helps users intake new cases, manage document workflows, monitor progress, generate reports, and ensure audit readiness.

## 🧠 Project Goals

- Simulate a real Agile product lifecycle (SAFe-based)
- Demonstrate Product Owner responsibilities:
  - Writing features and user stories
  - Managing the backlog
  - Leading sprint planning and reviews
  - Tracking Agile metrics
- Demonstrate knowledge of Definition of Done and acceptance criteria in SAFe
- Apply best practices like INVEST, Who-What-Why formatting, and Gherkin-style ACs
- Showcase ability to support sprint execution and operational readiness
- Build a GitHub portfolio project for resume and interview use

## 📂 Project Structure

- `/backlog/` → Features and user stories (Product Backlog)  
  – Includes a sample illustrating our approach to story writing, acceptance criteria, and Definition of Done  
- `/docs/` → Sprint plans, reviews, retrospectives, and metrics  
- `/assets/` → Visual diagrams or mockups  
- `/tools/` → Screenshots of Agile tools (e.g., Jira, Trello) [optional]  
- `/guides/` → Agile practice guides covering feature/story structure, estimation, DoD, compliance, and more
