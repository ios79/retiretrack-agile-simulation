# 🧩 User Story Structure Guide

This guide outlines how to write clear, valuable, and testable user stories using Agile best practices. User stories capture functionality from the user’s perspective and help ensure the product delivers real value.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of a User Story

A user story defines a small, vertical slice of functionality. It helps teams deliver incremental value and focus on the *why* behind every feature.

---

## 📐 Format – WHO / WHAT / WHY

> **As a** [user role],  
> **I want** [goal or task],  
> **So that** [benefit or value].

This format ensures each story is:
- User-focused
- Goal-oriented
- Value-driven

## 📌 Example from RetireTrack

> **As a** supervisor,  
> **I want to** assign cases to specific team members,  
> **So that** no case is left unattended.

## 🧠 The INVEST Checklist

Well-written user stories follow the **INVEST** acronym:

| Letter | Principle    | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I      | Independent  | Can be developed and tested in isolation                                |
| N      | Negotiable   | Discussed and refined collaboratively with the team                     |
| V      | Valuable     | Provides value to a user or stakeholder                                 |
| E      | Estimable    | Sized and estimated by the team                                         |
| S      | Small        | Can be delivered within a sprint                                        |
| T      | Testable     | Acceptance criteria define when the story is complete and working       |

## 🧾 The Three C’s of a User Story

Agile stories aren’t just requirements — they evolve through collaboration.

1. **Card** – A brief written description of the story (the placeholder).
2. **Conversation** – Dialogue between product owner, team, and stakeholders.
3. **Confirmation** – Defined acceptance criteria and Definition of Done.

---

## 🧭 Best Practices

- Keep stories focused on user value, not implementation details.
- Avoid combining multiple goals or roles in one story.
- Refine during grooming sessions to ensure clarity and shared understanding.
- Link each story to a parent Feature (especially in SAFe environments).
