**Purpose:** Explain how we ensure teams, processes, and systems are fully prepared for rollout and delivery in the RetireTrack Agile simulation project.

## 🎯 What Is Operational Readiness?

**Operational Readiness** means that everything required to successfully **launch, support, and maintain** a solution is in place.  
In SAFe, it's part of **Solution Context** and **Release Readiness**, ensuring smooth delivery and adoption.

---

## ✅ Our Approach in RetireTrack

We follow a structured, proactive approach that includes:

---

### 1. 📢 Communication Plans

- Notify users, stakeholders, and teams about the launch  
- Define **who gets informed, when, and how**  
- Prepare internal announcements or training invitations

---

### 2. 🧪 Testing Readiness

- Final regression and functional tests passed  
- QA sign-off documented  
- Test cases linked to Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done  
- Audit checkpoints reviewed (see `08_audit_compliance_agile_guide.md`)

---

### 3. 📘 Documentation Prepared

- 🗂️ **User guides**  
- 🧪 **Test plans**  
- 📝 **Training manuals**  
- 📋 **Process documentation**  

Each document is version-controlled and shared with stakeholders.

---

### 4. 👥 Training & Enablement

- Conducted walkthroughs with end users  
- Provided FAQs or help desk support structure  
- Collected feedback to fine-tune workflows  

---

### 5. 🗺️ Value Stream Mapping

We mapped key processes to identify:

- Hand-off points  
- Bottlenecks  
- Redundancy  
- Areas for automation or improvement  

See: `docs/value_stream_mapping_retiretrack.md`

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- ✅ Align readiness activities with sprint milestones  
- ✅ Treat readiness like a **feature** with its own tasks  
- ✅ Perform **go/no-go** reviews  
- ✅ Assign clear ownership for post-deployment support  

---

## 📦 Summary

Operational readiness bridges the gap between development and delivery.  
In RetireTrack, we treat it as a first-class concern to ensure:

- The solution is **tested and usable**  
- The team is **informed and supported**  
- The launch is **smooth and successful**
