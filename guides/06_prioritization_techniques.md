# ðŸš¦ 06_prioritization_techniques.md  
**Purpose:** Outline the prioritization techniques used in the RetireTrack Agile simulation to ensure we deliver the highest value features first.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Prioritization Matters

In Agile, not everything can be done at once.  
**Prioritization** helps us decide what to build next to deliver **maximum business value** and respond to **changing needs**.

---

## ðŸ§° Techniques We Use

We use **two complementary methods** to prioritize the backlog:

---

### 1. âœ… MoSCoW Method

This technique helps stakeholders categorize features by importance.

| Category     | Meaning                                           |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Must Have** | Critical for launch or compliance                 |
| **Should Have** | Important but not mandatory for initial release |
| **Could Have** | Nice to include if time permits                  |
| **Wonâ€™t Have (Now)** | Agreed to drop/postpone for now              |

#### Example:

- **Must Have**: Case intake form, document upload  
- **Should Have**: Status change alerts  
- **Could Have**: PDF export  
- **Wonâ€™t Have**: Mobile app version (for this phase)

---

### 2. âœ… Value-Based Prioritization

We evaluate stories by **value to users or business**.

#### Approaches:

- **Bang For The Buck (BFTB)**  
  > Prioritize stories with the **highest value per effort**.

- **WSJF â€“ Weighted Shortest Job First**  
  > Accounts for value, urgency, and risk.  
  > Used when more strategic prioritization is needed.

See the `05_story_point_estimation_guide.md` for detailed examples of BFTB and WSJF.

## ðŸ§  Best Practices

- âœ… Involve stakeholders in prioritization  
- âœ… Review and adjust priorities at every sprint planning  
- âœ… Consider dependencies, risk, and delivery timing  
- âœ… Use visual boards or ranking tables to guide discussion

---

## ðŸ§¾ Summary

- MoSCoW gives us **categorical clarity**
- BFTB and WSJF provide **quantitative prioritization**
- Together, they help us make **smarter delivery decisions**
