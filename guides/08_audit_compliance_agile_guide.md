# 🔒 08_audit_compliance_agile_guide.md  
**Purpose:** Document how we integrate audit and compliance practices into our Agile workflow in the RetireTrack simulation project.

## 🛡️ Why Audit & Compliance Matter

In highly regulated environments like **financial services**, audit and compliance ensure:

- Legal and regulatory requirements are met  
- Data integrity and privacy are protected  
- Processes are traceable and transparent  
- The organization avoids penalties or reputational risks

---

## ✅ Key Compliance Frameworks We Acknowledge

- **AML** – Anti-Money Laundering  
- **KYC** – Know Your Customer  
- **SOX** – Sarbanes-Oxley Act  
- **GDPR** – General Data Protection Regulation  
- **GLBA** – Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act  
- **ISO 27001** – Information Security Management

## 🔁 How We Ensure Compliance in Agile

### 1. 📋 Embedded Documentation at Every Phase

- Each user story includes **Acceptance Criteria** and **Definition of Done** that reflect compliance rules  
- All planning, review, and testing artifacts are version-controlled in GitHub for **traceability**  

---

### 2. 🧪 Audit Checkpoints in Test Plans

- We explicitly list **compliance checks** as test steps  
- Example: “Verify document upload is timestamped and user-tagged”  
- ✅ [Results logged in testing_checklist_sprint1.md](docs/testing_checklist_sprint1.md)


---

### 3. 🧠 Collaboration with Compliance Stakeholders

- We simulate regular collaboration between Agile teams and risk/compliance teams  
- Involve them in backlog grooming and sprint planning  
- Ensure all controls are accounted for before go-live

---

### 4. 📁 Version Control and Transparency

- GitHub repositories act as **system of record**  
- All sprint artifacts, definitions, testing results, and documents are tracked with commit history

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

- ✅ Treat compliance as a **non-negotiable requirement**, not a blocker  
- ✅ Involve audit/compliance roles early and often  
- ✅ Align Definition of Done with regulatory checkpoints  
- ✅ Regularly review and adapt compliance processes to Agile pace

---

## ✅ Summary

Compliance is not separate from Agile — it’s **built into the process**.  
In RetireTrack, we use automation, documentation, and transparency to ensure compliance while maintaining Agile velocity.

This shows our readiness for **enterprise-scale delivery** in regulated industries like MetLife’s.
