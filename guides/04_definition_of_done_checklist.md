# ✅ 04_definition_of_done_checklist.md  
**Purpose:** Establish a consistent and transparent Definition of Done (DoD) across all user stories and features in the RetireTrack Agile simulation project.

---

## 🧾 What Is the Definition of Done?

The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is an agreed-upon checklist of requirements that a product increment must satisfy **to be considered complete**. It ensures shared understanding between all stakeholders — including business, development, QA, and product leadership.

DoD applies **universally** to all user stories, tasks, and features.

---

## 🎯 Why DoD Matters

- Promotes **transparency** and shared expectations  
- Supports **quality control** and prevents incomplete work  
- Aligns development with **compliance**, **documentation**, and **business needs**  
- Enables effective **sprint review**, **closure**, and **release readiness**

## 📋 Definition of Done – RetireTrack Simulation Checklist

| ✅ Task | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📌 **Acceptance Criteria Met** | All user story ACs are implemented and verified |
| 🔍 **Code Reviewed** | Code has been peer-reviewed or approved by a reviewer |
| ✅ **Test Coverage Complete** | Unit/integration tests written and passed |
| 🧪 **Tested in Simulated Environment** | Functionality verified in Jira/Trello or prototype |
| 📄 **Documentation Updated** | Related docs (e.g. process guides, training notes) updated |
| 🧠 **Knowledge Shared** | Shared with team in stand-up, demo, or retrospective |
| 🔒 **Compliance Checked** | Features reviewed for audit/traceability (if applicable) |
| 📂 **Merged & Pushed** | Code merged to main branch or simulation artifact committed |

## 🧠 Tips for Using DoD Effectively

- Include DoD in **each sprint planning session**  
- Reference DoD during **stand-ups**, **reviews**, and **retrospectives**  
- Link DoD items to **Definition of Ready** (DoR) for end-to-end traceability  
- Consider maintaining a **visual checklist** (e.g. in a shared Jira ticket template)

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Declaring “done” without testing or documentation  
- ❌ Skipping code review or verification steps  
- ❌ Inconsistent DoD usage across teams or features  
- ❌ Treating DoD as optional or “nice-to-have”  

---

## ✅ Summary

> “Done means DONE.”  
In the RetireTrack Agile simulation, the DoD ensures that work delivered is **complete, reliable, and ready for business value delivery** — not just code that runs.

Always verify each item in the checklist before moving a story or feature to **Done**.
