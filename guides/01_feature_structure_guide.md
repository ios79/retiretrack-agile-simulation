# 🧩 Feature Structure – Writing Effective Features in SAFe

In the SAFe Agile framework, a **Feature** represents a service or capability that fulfills a stakeholder need and delivers business value. Features are larger than user stories but smaller than epics, and they should be independently deliverable within a Program Increment (PI).

## ✅ What Makes a Good Feature?

A well-written feature should:

- Deliver **value** to the customer or end-user
- Be **sized appropriately** to fit within a PI (typically delivered within a sprint or two)
- Be **independent**, clearly defined, and testable
- Include **benefit hypothesis** and **acceptance criteria**

---

## 📝 Recommended Format (SAFe)

**Title:** Clear, action-oriented name

**Benefit Hypothesis:**  
_Why are we building this feature? What business problem or customer need does it solve?_

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
_A set of high-level conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered complete and valuable._

## 🧠 Feature Example (from RetireTrack)

**Feature:** 📦 Case Intake & Assignment

**Benefit Hypothesis:**  
Streamlining the intake process and enabling case assignment will reduce delays and ensure every retirement case is handled promptly by the right team member.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Case can only be submitted when all mandatory fields are completed
- Supervisor can assign a case to a specific team member
- Confirmation message is displayed upon successful case creation

## 🎯 Prioritization Techniques for Features

Prioritizing features helps deliver the most value early in the development cycle.

### 1. MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have:** Critical for launch or compliance
- **Should Have:** Important, but not critical
- **Could Have:** Nice to have, enhances UX or scalability
- **Won’t Have (Now):** Not included in this PI/sprint

### 2. Value-Based Prioritization
Assign **Value Points** to each feature based on customer impact, urgency, or strategic alignment.

### 3. Bang for the Buck (BFTB)
Calculate the ratio of **Value Points / Story Points** to prioritize high-value, low-effort features first.

## 🔄 Linking Features to User Stories

Each feature should be broken down into multiple **user stories**.  
This supports vertical slicing and allows incremental delivery of functionality.

> _A good rule of thumb: If a feature can't be split into at least two user stories, it's probably not a true feature._
