# 🧱 Product Backlog – RetireTrack

## 📦 Feature 1: Case Intake & Assignment
- As a case manager, I want to input client details into a form so that I can create a new case.
- As a supervisor, I want to assign cases to specific team members so that no case is left unattended.
- As a user, I want to see a confirmation once a case is submitted so that I know it's in the system.

## 📦 Feature 2: Document Upload & Review
- As a team member, I want to upload documents (PDFs, Excel) to a case so that client info is centralized.
- As a reviewer, I want to mark a document as “Reviewed” or “Rejected” so that everyone knows the status.
- As an auditor, I want document uploads to be tracked with timestamps for compliance purposes.

## 📦 Feature 3: Status Tracking & Notifications
- As a case manager, I want to update the case status (e.g., “In Progress”, “Awaiting Docs”) so others stay informed.
- As a user, I want to receive email alerts when my case is updated so I can act quickly.
- As a stakeholder, I want a dashboard view showing case statuses and bottlenecks.

## 📦 Feature 4: Reporting & Metrics
- As a supervisor, I want to generate weekly reports of open and closed cases so I can track performance.
- As a manager, I want to visualize time-to-resolution per case so I can identify delays.
- As a compliance officer, I want to download audit logs of user activity for review.

## 📦 Feature 5: Access Control & Security
- As an admin, I want to assign roles (e.g., viewer, editor) to users so that permissions are controlled.
- As a user, I want to see only the cases I’m allowed to access so I don’t view restricted data.
- As an IT auditor, I want logs of login history and access attempts to monitor security.
