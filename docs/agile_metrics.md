## ðŸ§­ Planned Metrics to Track in Later Sprints:
- ðŸ“ˆ Team Velocity (points per sprint)
- ðŸ“¥ Story Completion Rate
- ðŸ§ª Defect Leakage (simulated)
- ðŸŸ¢ Cumulative Flow (optional visualization)

This file will evolve as the simulation progresses through Sprint 1 and Sprint 2.

### ðŸ“… Day 4 Update (April 17)
- ðŸ“‰ Chart updated to show steady progress.
- âœ… RAS-1, RAS-2 complete
