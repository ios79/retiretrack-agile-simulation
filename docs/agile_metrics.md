## ðŸ“‰ Sprint 1 Burndown Chart

The burndown chart below tracks the amount of remaining work (story points) throughout the sprint:

- **Sprint Length**: 10 working days (April 14 â€“ April 28, 2025)
- **Total Story Points**: 14
- **Completed by Day 2**: 6 story points (RAS-1 to RAS-4 moved to In Progress)

### ðŸ”Ž Insights:
- The actual progress is ahead of the ideal curve (faster than planned).
- Execution is smooth and no major blockers have been simulated.
- Verification for stories in progress will begin next (Day 3).

## ðŸ§­ Planned Metrics to Track in Later Sprints:
- ðŸ“ˆ Team Velocity (points per sprint)
- ðŸ“¥ Story Completion Rate
- ðŸ§ª Defect Leakage (simulated)
- ðŸŸ¢ Cumulative Flow (optional visualization)

This file will evolve as the simulation progresses through Sprint 1 and Sprint 2.
