# üîÅ Sprint 1 Retrospective ‚Äì RetireTrack Agile Simulation

**Sprint Dates:** April 14 ‚Äì April 18, 2025  
**Team:** Simulated Business Solutions Consultant, Scrum Master (AI-facilitated), Development Team (simulated)  
**Facilitator:** Sprint retrospective compiled post-sprint based on execution records and artifacts.

## ‚úÖ What Went Well

- **Sprint Goal Fully Achieved:** All committed user stories (RAS-1 to RAS-6) were completed within the sprint timeline.
- **Clear Backlog and Acceptance Criteria:** Well-defined stories helped streamline daily execution and reduce ambiguity.
- **Consistent Documentation:** Daily updates to the board, release plan, burndown charts, and testing checklist provided strong traceability.
- **Early User Story Validation:** Stories were validated before closure, reducing rework and ensuring readiness.
- **Simulation Discipline Maintained:** Despite being a simulation, Agile ceremonies (planning, review, testing, retrospective) were properly followed and documented.

## üß≠ Areas for Improvement

- **Story Breakdown:** RAS-6, which included both audit logging and timestamping, could have been split into two smaller stories for better estimation and clarity.
- **Early Metrics Setup:** Burndown tracking started on Day 2. In future sprints, it should begin from Day 1 to improve velocity visibility.
- **README Synchronization:** README updates lagged behind execution initially but were corrected later; we‚Äôll ensure it's updated incrementally moving forward.
